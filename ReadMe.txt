This Matlab code is the implementation of CLONAX proposed by Anuraganand Sharma in the paper:
A. Sharma and D. Sharma, Clonal Selection Algorithm for Classification, in Artificial Immune Systems, vol. 6825, P. Liò, G. Nicosia, and T. Stibor, Eds. Berlin, Heidelberg: Springer Berlin Heidelberg, 2011, pp. 361–370

How to run:
1 - Run CLONAX_train.m to train CLONAX. It will generate memory file '*data_memory.out'.
2 - Run CLONAX_test.m to test CLONAX. You will be required to input two files. (1) 'test_*.data' for test data file and (2) memory file '*data_memory.out'. Both files can be found in 'data' folder.
